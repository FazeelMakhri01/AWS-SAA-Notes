# ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)


## üß≠ Overview

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
You can provision **Linux**, **Windows**, or **Mac** virtual servers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Limits
- **On-Demand Instances:** Limited by your vCPU-based On-Demand limit.  
- **Reserved Instances:** Max 20 per account.  
- **Spot Instances:** Limited by dynamic Spot limit per region.  
- **New AWS accounts** may have lower default limits.

- **Savings Plan:** Commit monthly spend  
- **Spot:** Grab discounted unused capacity  
- **Dedicated Host:** Own the entire server  
- **Capacity Reservation:** Reserve space even if unused  

---

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Nitro System:** Enhanced security & near bare-metal performance  
- **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA):** Low-latency networking for HPC/ML

- **EC2 Instance Connect:** Browser-based SSH access  
- **EC2 Fleet / Spot Fleet:** Mix On-Demand, Reserved, Spot instances  

### üß† Best Practices
- Use **IMDSv2** for metadata access  
- Enable **Detailed Monitoring** (<1-min metrics)  
- Use **Placement Groups** (Cluster, Spread, Partition)  
- Enable **Auto Scaling** for elasticity & high availability  
- Use **AWS Systems Manager** for automation  
- Monitor costs with **Cost Explorer** & **Compute Optimizer**

## üîÅ Instance States

| State | Description | Billing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | Runs normally | Billed continuously |
| Stop | Shuts down, EBS persists | No usage charges |
| Hibernate | Writes memory to EBS | Billed for EBS & Elastic IPs |
| Terminate | Deletes instance | Billing stops; EBS optional persistence |

**Notes:**
- **Instance Store-backed** instances cannot be stopped, only started/terminated.  
- Enable **termination protection** to prevent accidental deletions.

---

## üíæ Root Device Volumes

| Volume Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Instance Store | Temporary; deleted on stop/terminate |
| EBS-backed | Persistent; supports stop/start |

**Modifications:**
- **EBS-backed:** Change instance type, kernel, RAM disk (while stopped)  
- **Instance Store:** Fixed attributes; no stop state

---

## üß± Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

| Feature | EBS-backed | Instance Store-backed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Boot Time | <1 min | <5 min |
| Root Volume Size | Up to 64 TiB | 10 GiB |
| Data Persistence | EBS persists | Lost on termination |
| Modifications | Supported | Not supported |
| Stopped State | Supported | Not supported |

**Details:**
- AMI includes root volume template, permissions, block device mapping.  
- AMIs can be copied across regions.  
- Deleted AMIs can be restored from **Recycle Bin**.  
- Supports **UEFI Secure Boot** and **IMDSv2** configuration.

---

## üß∞ EC2 Image Builder

- Automates creation and management of AMIs.  
- Custom images are owned by your account.  
- Supports automatic **patching, updating, and pipelines**.

---

## üíµ EC2 Pricing Details

- **On-Demand:** No upfront cost, per-second billing.  
- **Reserved Instances (RI):** Standard (max discount) or Convertible (flexible).  
- **Spot Instances:** Up to 90% off, but interruptible.  
- **Dedicated Hosts/Instances:** Physical isolation, for compliance.  
- **Capacity Reservations:** Hold capacity, combine with RI/Savings Plans for discount.

---

## üîí Security

- Manage access using **IAM**.  
- **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls for instances.
