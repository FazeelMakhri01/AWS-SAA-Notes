# Amazon CloudFront & AWS Global Accelerator

## 🚀 Amazon CloudFront (CDN)

### 🔹 1. Overview
Amazon **CloudFront** is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** that securely delivers static, dynamic, streaming, and API content to users globally with **low latency** and **high transfer speed**.

- Uses a global network of **edge locations** to cache and serve content closer to users.  
- Requests are routed to the **nearest edge location** for optimal performance.  
- If content isn’t cached, CloudFront retrieves it from the **origin** (e.g., S3, EC2, ALB).

---

### 🔹 2. Core Components
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Origin** | The original source of content (S3, EC2, ALB, or custom server). |
| **Distribution** | The CloudFront configuration defining how content is delivered. |
| **Edge Location** | Cache endpoint for delivering content to nearby users. |
| **Regional Edge Cache** | Intermediate cache layer between edge locations and origins for better performance. |

---

### 🔹 3. How CloudFront Works
1. Upload content to your **origin** (S3, EC2, or custom HTTP server).  
2. Create a **CloudFront distribution** linked to the origin.  
3. CloudFront provides a unique domain name (e.g., `d123abc.cloudfront.net`).  
4. Users access content via that domain.  
5. CloudFront routes the request to the **nearest edge location**.  
6. Cached content → served immediately; otherwise fetched from origin and cached.

💡 **CloudFront uses AWS’s private network** between edge locations and origins for secure, fast, and reliable delivery.

---

### 🔹 4. Supported Protocols & Methods
- **Protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket  
- **HTTP Methods:** `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`

---

### 🔹 5. Caching & Optimization
- CloudFront **caches content** at edge locations to minimize latency.  
- Controlled via **Cache-Control** or **Expires** headers.  
  - Example: `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` → cache for 1 hour.
- TTL Settings: **Min TTL**, **Max TTL**, and **Default TTL** (per behavior).  
- **Query Strings, Cookies, and Headers** can be used as cache keys.

**Invalidations:**  
- Use invalidation requests (e.g., `/*`) to remove cached objects manually.

---

### 🔹 6. Cache Behaviors
Define how CloudFront handles specific paths and origins.

| Configuration | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Path Pattern** | Define route (e.g., `/images/*`) |
| **Origin Routing** | Choose which origin serves which paths |
| **Query String Forwarding** | Control how query parameters affect cache |
| **HTTPS Enforcement** | Require HTTPS-only access |
| **Signed URLs/Cookies** | Restrict access to private content |
| **Cache & Origin Policies** | Fine-tune TTL, cache keys, compression, and forwarding behavior |

---

### 🔹 7. Lambda@Edge
- Run **serverless functions** at edge locations.  
- Modify requests/responses in real time.  
- Common use cases:
  - Redirects / URL rewrites  
  - Header modifications  
  - Custom authentication  
  - A/B testing  
  - SEO optimizations

---

### 🔹 8. Price Classes
Control cost by choosing which regions serve your content.

| Price Class | Regions Included |
|--------------|------------------|
| **100** | US, Canada, Europe |
| **200** | Adds Asia & Oceania |
| **All Edge Locations** | Global (default) |

---

### 🔹 9. Security & Access Control
| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AWS WAF Integration** | Protects against SQLi, XSS, and HTTP floods |
| **AWS Shield** | DDoS protection (network & app layers) |
| **SSL/TLS** | Encrypts data in transit |
| **Geo-Restriction** | Restrict access by location |
| **Origin Access Control (OAC)** | Secure S3 origins (replaces OAI) |
| **Field-Level Encryption** | Encrypts sensitive form data (e.g., credit cards) |
| **Custom HTTP Headers** | Restrict origin access to CloudFront-only traffic |
| **Response Headers Policy** | Modify or strip response headers |
| **Managed Prefix List** | Limit origin inbound traffic to CloudFront IPs |

---

### 🔹 10. Compliance
✅ **PCI DSS** – for payment data  
✅ **HIPAA-eligible** – for healthcare data  
✅ **SOC 1 / SOC 2 / SOC 3** – compliance-ready

---

### 🔹 11. Pricing Overview
You pay for:
- **Data Transfer Out** to the internet or between regions  
- **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**  
- **Invalidation Requests** (first 1,000 free/month)  
- **Custom SSL (Dedicated IP)**  
- **Field-Level Encryption**  
- **S3 costs** if S3 is used as origin  

💡 Optimize with caching, compression, and limited invalidations to reduce costs.

---

### 🔹 12. CloudFront vs S3 Cross-Region Replication
| Feature | CloudFront | S3 CRR |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Global content delivery (read-only caching) | Cross-region redundancy (full data replication) |
| **Setup** | Single origin, multiple edge locations | Configure per target region |
| **Cost** | Pay for data transfer & requests | Pay for storage + replication |
| **Use Case** | Low-latency global access | Backup or compliance data replication |
